		<h2>
			What is a payday loan?
		</h2>
		<p>
			A payday loan is a short-term loan that is typically paid back on your next direct
			deposit date and intended for those times when you need a little extra cash between
			direct deposits.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What is required to get a loan from EZMoney?</h2>
		<p>
			It's easy. All you need to apply is your regular income information, checking account
			information, email address, references and other contact information. You must also
			be at least 18 years old to, not currently be a debtor in a bankruptcy case or presently
			intend to voluntarily file for bankruptcy relief, and able to be contacted during
			normal business hours. Generally, no additional documents are required to be faxed
			to receive a loan.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What if I have bad credit or no credit?
		</h2>
		<p>
			No problem. You can still qualify for a loan with us, even if you have bad credit,
			slow credit or no credit. Simply complete the online application form and as soon
			as we are able to verify your personal information, you could be approved for one
			of our loans.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What is the cost for obtaining this loan? How much can I borrow?
		</h2>
		<p>
			See our <a href="/RatesAndTerms">rates and terms</a> page for
			specific details regarding fees and charges as well as loan limits.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How does the loan process work?
		</h2>
		<p>
			You complete our easy online loan application, and we will quickly notify you whether
			you have been approved. If approved, you will be presented with your transaction
			documents and applicable disclosures so that you can read them carefully and completely.
			If you agree with everything, you will be asked to electronically sign the transaction
			documents, then the loan funds will be deposited directly into your checking account,
			generally by the next business day.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How will I know if I am approved for a loan?
		</h2>
		<p>
			EZMoney will immediately notify you if you are approved for a loan or if any additional
			information will need to be provided to one of our helpful Service Representatives.
			If you have to step away from your computer, we will send you an email, a text message,
			or contact you by phone. EZMoney may make changes to your approval amount based
			upon verification of information that you provide.
		</p>
		<h2>
			When will the money be in my account?
		</h2>
		<p>
			If your application is received and approved by 5:00 p.m. Central Time Monday-Friday,
			we will generally be able to transfer the money to your checking account by the
			next business day. The exact time for availability of funds is subject to your bank's
			processing schedules, policies and holidays.
		</p>
		<h2>
			How do I pay my loan back?
		</h2>
		<p>
			On your loan due date, we will conduct an electronic funds transfer debit from your
			checking account for the total amount due.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Can I pay my loan back early?
		</h2>
		<p>
			Yes, you can pay your loan back early. Contact us to let us know that you want us
			to debit your checking account earlier than the due date.
		</p>
		<h2>
			What if I can't pay the total amount due on the due date?
		</h2>
		<p>
			In some states, you may be eligible to renew your loan by paying only the interest
			or fees that have accrued and obtaining a new loan to cover the remaining balance.
			See our rates and terms page for information about whether renewals are allowed
			in your state. If you are eligible to renew your loan, but you do not log into your
			account and set it up for renewal prior to the loan due date, then your checking
			account will be debited for the total amount due, so be sure and set up a renewal
			if you think you may need one.
		</p>
		<h2>
			Will EZMoney conduct a credit check or any other verification?
		</h2>
		<p>
			EZMoney does not pull a credit report from Experian, Equifax, or Transunion. EZMoney
			does, however, utilize a sophisticated underwriting tool which uses information
			from various other alternative consumer reporting agencies that verify your identification
			and other information.
